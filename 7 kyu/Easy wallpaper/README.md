# Easy wallpaper

John wants to decorate the walls of a room with wallpaper. He wants a fool-proof method for getting it right.

John knows that the rectangular room has a length of `l` meters, a width of `w` meters, a height of `h` meters. The
standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is `52` centimeters. The length of a roll is `10` meters. He bears in mind
however, that itâ€™s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he wants to
buy a length `15%` greater than the one he needs.

Last time he did these calculations he got a headache, so could you help John?

<b>Task</b>

Your function `wallpaper(l, w, h)` should return as a plain English word in lower case the number of rolls he must buy.

<b>Example:</b>

`wallpaper(4.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "ten"`

`wallpaper(0.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "zero"`

<b>Notes:</b>

- all rolls (even with incomplete width) are put edge to edge

- 0 <= l, w, h (floating numbers); it can happens that `w * h * l` is zero

- the integer `r` (number of rolls) will always be less or equal to 20

- FORTH: the number of rolls will be a positive or null integer (not a plain English word; this number can be greater
  than 20)

```
numbers = ["zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine", "ten", "eleven", "twelve","thirteen", "fourteen", "fifteen", "sixteen", "seventeen", "eighteen", "nineteen", "twenty"]
```

- For other languages it is not preloaded but you can use the above one if you need it.
