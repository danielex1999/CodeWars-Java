# Nth power rules them all!

You are provided with an array of positive integers and an additional integer `n` (`n > 1`).

Calculate the sum of each value in the array to the nth power. Then subtract the sum of the original array.

**Examples**

```
{1, 2, 3}, 3  -->  (1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 ) - (1 + 2 + 3)  -->  36 - 6  -->  30
{1, 2}, 5     -->  (1^5 + 2^5) - (1 + 2)             -->  33 - 3  -->  30
```
