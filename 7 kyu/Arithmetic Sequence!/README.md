A sequence is usually a set or an array of numbers that has a strict way for moving from the nth term to the (n+1)th
term.

If `f(n) = f(n-1) + c` where `c` is a constant value, then `f` is an arithmetic sequence.

An example would be (where the first term is 0 and the constant is 1) is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... and so on] )

Else if (pun) `f(n) = f(n-1) * c` where `c` is a constant value, then `f` is a geometric sequence.

Example where the first term is 2 and the constant is 2 will be [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, ... to infinity ... ]

There are some sequences that aren't arithmetic nor are they geometric.

Here is a link to feed your brain : Sequence !

You're going to write a function that's going to return the value in the nth index of an arithmetic sequence.(That is,
adding a constant to move to the next element in the "set").

The function's name is `nthterm`/`Nthterm`, it takes three inputs `first`,`n`,`c` where:

- `first` is the first value in the 0 INDEX.
- `n` is the index of the value we want.
- `c` is the constant added between the terms.
  Remember that `first` is in the index `0` .. just saying ...
