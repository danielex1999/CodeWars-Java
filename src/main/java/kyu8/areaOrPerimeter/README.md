# Area or Perimeter

You are given the ```length``` and ```width``` of a 4-sided polygon. The polygon can either be a rectangle or a square.
If it is a square, return its area. If it is a rectangle, return its perimeter.

```java
area_or_perimeter(6, 10) --> 32
area_or_perimeter(3, 3) --> 9
```

Note: for the purposes of this kata you will assume that it is a square if its ```length``` and ```width``` are equal,
otherwise it is a rectangle.
