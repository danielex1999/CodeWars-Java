# FIXME: Get Full Name

![](https://i.imgur.com/ta6gv1i.png?1)

The code provided is supposed return a person's <b>Full Name</b> given their `first` and `last` names.

But it's not working properly.

<b>Notes</b>

The first and/or last names are never null, but may be empty.

<b>Task</b>

Fix the bug so we can all go home early.
