# Happy Birthday

It's your best friend's birthday! You already bought a box for the present. Now you want to pack the present in the box.
You want to decorate the box with a ribbon and a bow.

But how much cm of ribbon do you need?

Write the method `wrap` that calculates that!

A box has a `height`, a `width` and a `length` (in cm). The ribbon is crossed on the side with the largest area.
Opposite this side (also the side with the largest area) the loop is bound, calculate with `20` cm more tape.

```
  wrap(17,32,11) => 162
  wrap(13,13,13) => 124
  wrap(1,3,1) => 32
 ```

Notes:

`height`, `width` and `length` will always be `>0`
