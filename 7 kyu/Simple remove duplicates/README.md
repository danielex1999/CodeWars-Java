# Simple remove duplicates

In this Kata, you will remove the left-most duplicates from a list of integers and return the result.

```
// Remove the 3's at indices 0 and 3
// followed by removing a 4 at index 1
solve([3, 4, 4, 3, 6, 3]); // => [4, 6, 3]
```

More examples can be found in the test cases.

Good luck!
