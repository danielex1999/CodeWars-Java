# Classic Hello World

You are given a method called ```main```, make it print the line ```Hello World!``` and don't return anything

Note that for some languages, the function ```main``` is the entry point of the program.

Here's how it will be tested:

```java
    java Solution.class parameter1 parameter2
```

Hints:

1. Check your references
2. Think about the scope of your method
3. For prolog you can use write but there are better ways
4. If you still don't get it probably you can define main as an attribute of the Solution class that accepts a single
   argument, and that only prints "Hello World!" without any return.
