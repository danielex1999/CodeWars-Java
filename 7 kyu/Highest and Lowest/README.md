# Highest and Lowest

In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest
number.

<b>Example:</b>

```
highAndLow("1 2 3 4 5")  // return "5 1"
highAndLow("1 2 -3 4 5") // return "5 -3"
highAndLow("1 9 3 4 -5") // return "9 -5"
```

<b>Notes:</b>

- All numbers are valid `Int32`, no need to validate them.
- There will always be at least one number in the input string.
- Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first.
