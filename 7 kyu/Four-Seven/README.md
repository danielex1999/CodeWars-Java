# Four Seven

Simple kata, simple rules: your function should accept the inputs `4` and `7`. If `4` is entered, the function should
return `7`. If `7` is entered, the function should return `4`. Anything else entered as input should return `0`. There's
only one catch, your function cannot include if statements, switch statements, or the ternary operator.

There are some very simple ways of answering this problem, but I encourage you to try and be as creative as possible.

Good Luck!
