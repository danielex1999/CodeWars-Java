# The old switcheroo

Write a function

```
vowel2Index(String s)
```

that takes in a string and replaces all the vowels [a,e,i,o,u] with their respective positions within that string.

E.g:

```
Kata.Vowel2Index("this is my string") == "th3s 6s my str15ng"
Kata.Vowel2Index("Codewars is the best site in the world") == "C2d4w6rs 10s th15 b18st s23t25 27n th32 w35rld"
```

<b>Your function should be case insensitive to the vowels.</b>
