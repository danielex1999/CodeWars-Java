# FIXME: Static electrickery

The code provided has a method `plus100` which is supposed to return the number of the parameter incremented by 100.

But it's not working properly.

# Task

Fix the code so we can all go home early.

## Restrictions

* Do not modify the constructor
* Do not modify the `plus100` method
* Do not modify the `ONE_HUNDRED` declaration
