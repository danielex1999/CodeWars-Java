# Leonardo Dicaprio and Oscars

You have to write a function that describe Leo:

```java
def leo(oscar):
  pass
```

if oscar was (integer) 88, you have to return "Leo finally won the oscar! Leo is happy".</br>
if oscar was 86, you have to return "Not even for Wolf of wallstreet?!"</br>
if it was not 88 or 86 (and below 88) you should return "When will you give Leo an Oscar?"</br>
if it was over 88 you should return "Leo got one already!"
