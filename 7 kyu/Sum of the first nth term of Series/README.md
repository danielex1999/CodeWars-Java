# Sum of the first nth term of Series

<b>Task:</b>

Your task is to write a function which returns the sum of following series upto nth term(parameter).

```
Series: 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 + 1/16 +...
```

<b>Rules:</b>

- You need to round the answer to 2 decimal places and return it as String.

- If the given value is 0 then it should return 0.00

- You will only be given Natural Numbers as arguments.

<b>Examples:</b>

```
SeriesSum(1) => 1 = "1.00"
SeriesSum(2) => 1 + 1/4 = "1.25"
SeriesSum(5) => 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 = "1.57"
```

<b>NOTE:</b> In PHP the function is called `series_sum()`.
