# Waiting room

There's a waiting room with N chairs set in single row. Chairs are consecutively numbered from 1 to N. First is closest
to the entrance (which is exit as well).

For some reason people choose a chair in the following way

1. Find a place as far from other people as possible
2. Find a place as close to exit as possible
   All chairs must be occupied before the first person will be served

So it looks like this for 10 chairs and 10 patients

 Chairs   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9  | 10 
----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|---- 
 Patients | 1 | 7 | 5 | 8 | 3 | 9 | 4 | 6 | 10 | 2  

Your task is to find last patient's chair's number.

Input - N - integer greater than 2 - number of chairs. Output should positive integer too - last patient's chair's
number

Have fun :)
