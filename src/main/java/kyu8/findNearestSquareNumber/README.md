# Find Nearest square number

Your task is to find the nearest square number, `nearest_sq(n)` or `nearestSq(n)`, of a positive integer n.

For example, if `n = 111`, then `nearest\_sq(n)` (`nearestSq(n)`) equals 121, since 111 is closer to 121, the square of 11,
than 100, the square of 10.

If the `n` is already the perfect square (e.g. `n = 144`, `n = 81`, etc.), you need to just return `n`.

Good luck :)
